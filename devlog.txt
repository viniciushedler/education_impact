I started by downloading the data from UNData (yesterday)
Every row is composed by index, country, year, column_name, value and some other things I'm not interested into
While exploring the datastructure I was reading only the column names and one row
That cost me some time because at some point I thought the column 'column_name' had only one value
I saw it was wrong when looking to the 'GDP and GDP per capita' dataset
The dataset has the name of two variables but only has one??
To be honest this is a relief, because I was worried having so few columns would be a problem
Also, this error is what motivated me to begin this devlog

I made the function to read the csvs in the way I wanted
It was somewhat easy to be honest
I just had to read, rename and pivot to get intermediate df
This dataframe had the values of the column 'Series' as columns and the value of the column 'Value' as value
Then I joined this df to the intermediate df, which just added the country and year columns
And then I used a groupby by year and country and summed the rows that were grouped
This way I can check all variables for a given country in a given year by looking into one row

I found out that some values in the dataframe are in the style of '1,089.1'
It should be easy to cast this to float with df.map
Except that I thought map worked inplace, and didn't assign the return value
So I spent a lot of time changing the casting function and debbuging, while all I had to do was save the result of my map
Also I had forgotten to drop the column 'Series', which was left in there
Now I really got a df with a row being a country, a year, and many NUMERIC columns with the wanted variables (value may be None)
Time to commit
